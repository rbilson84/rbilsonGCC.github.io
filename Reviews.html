<p class="review">‘Rachel was perfect, made us feel immediately that our cat was in the safest hands and sent us regular lovely updates on how she was getting on while we were away. I would recommend her to anyone without hesitation and will definitely use her again. Shiro will not forgive us if we don’t let her see her again!’ - John</p>

        <p class="review">‘Rachel took time to meet Juno and gain her trust before the booking. She is very friendly, took on board comments about Junos character and took great care of her for me. I got several updates which were great and very reassuring.’ − Katie</p>

        <p class="review">‘Rachel looked after my cat Cleo whilst I was away for a week on holiday. This is the second time she has taken care of her whilst I’ve been away. As usual she done a sterling job, she is always very patient with her as she is quite timid. Rachel also takes the time to send daily updates and videos so I know she is in good hands.’ − Donna</p>
