<h2>About Rachel's Rascals</h2>
<p>In April 2020, i sustained an acute spinal chord injury which changed everything but also gave me the oportunity to stop, reset and think about what would make me happy. 
    I have always been a lover of animals and had pets throughout my life and would always tell people that my dream job would be working with animals.
    Taking time to recover from the spinal injury during Covid-19 Pandemic, allowed me to enrol on a distance learning course with Barony College on the Principles of animal care.
    This allowed me to learn and understand different aspects of what would be required to work with animals.</p>

    <p>During 2021, i did some occasional cat sitting through Cat in a flat and the idea of Rachel's Rascals began. (with the help and encouragement of my partner). With the help of repeat bookings and reviews on Cat in a Flat, it has, over time become a part-time job i absolutely adore.</p>
